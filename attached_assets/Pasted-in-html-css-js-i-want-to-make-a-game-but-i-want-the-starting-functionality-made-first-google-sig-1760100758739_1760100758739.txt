in html/css/js i want to make a game, but i want the starting functionality made first:
- google signup/login system
using firebase SDK, all data will be saved into the Firestore DB, and users can aces the site through their google account

<script type="module">
  // Import the functions you need from the SDKs you need
  import { initializeApp } from "https://www.gstatic.com/firebasejs/12.4.0/firebase-app.js";
  import { getAnalytics } from "https://www.gstatic.com/firebasejs/12.4.0/firebase-analytics.js";
  // TODO: Add SDKs for Firebase products that you want to use
  // https://firebase.google.com/docs/web/setup#available-libraries

  // Your web app's Firebase configuration
  // For Firebase JS SDK v7.20.0 and later, measurementId is optional
  const firebaseConfig = {
    apiKey: "AIzaSyAig5NZUSZQBpvc3mQk4TfuCOfVr2DfaUE",
    authDomain: "pokeronlinev2.firebaseapp.com",
    projectId: "pokeronlinev2",
    storageBucket: "pokeronlinev2.firebasestorage.app",
    messagingSenderId: "550772836623",
    appId: "1:550772836623:web:96ebcf43ade04b9aa8967a",
    measurementId: "G-Z8HC47ZFGM"
  };

  // Initialize Firebase
  const app = initializeApp(firebaseConfig);
  const analytics = getAnalytics(app);
</script>

all databases should be created dynamically, when the first user signsup, all needed databases should be created dynamically for the first time

when a user signs up, the game will use their google username (their email just without @gmail.com) as the players actual username
however; they can change this username once a week, they can change it right away if they dont wnat theyre actual email tied to their account

menu:
when a player finally signs in / logins in, the menu is shown, the site will be a dark modern simplistic thtme
all game buttons will be on the left bottomish, liek the rocket league Ui.
in the middle / emtpy space of the page is the players party (or just the player if no party), where it shows players pFP (google pfp or ciustom pfp) and display name underneath
when the player is in a party, then all party members will show here as well, with the local players stuff being a bit bigger


buttons:
Play
Item Shop
Inventory
Season Pass
Profile
Settings

play, item, inventory, season pass wont work for now (disable these)
Profile will work it will bring a popup where user can:
- change display name, pfp
and they can later:
- change title and banner

Settings
- change actual username, and friend / party settings

party:
- bottom right is a friends icon, clicking it brings a side popup, showing Online friends 
[pfp] [displayName]
      [in-game activity]
6 tabs:
Party (if in party), Online Friends, All Friends, Notifications, Recently Played With, Add Freind (brings a popup to add a username, when enterd, checks if user exist, if not return "User Does Not Exist", if found, send that specified user a notification that this user wants to friend them)

clicking on a player brings a dropdown:
Invite to Party
Add Friend (if not friend)
Remove Friend (if friend)

when a player invites someone to a party, that user gets the notification to join or ignore the invite
joining the party updates party ui, and the one who started the party is the party leader (can kick/promote users)

this is the bare minium, all of this must be complete, with fully working friend / party system
